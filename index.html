        <p>Tom's Lab is a growing online community of chemistry enthusiasts that surrounds my YouTube channel. There you can find <br>
           educational and entertaining videos covering all aspects of chemistry. Video production has slowed because Tom became <br>
                very busy, but (somewhat) regular posts should return soon. </p>
