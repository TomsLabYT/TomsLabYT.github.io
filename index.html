        <p>Tom's Lab is a growing online community of chemistry enthusiasts that surrounds my YouTube channel. There you can find <br>
           educational and entertaining videos covering all aspects of chemistry. Video production has slowed because Tom became <br>
                very busy, but (somewhat) regular posts should return soon. </p>
                
        <h2>The Lab</h2>
        <p>I started my home lab back in 2015 in a small spare bathroom with limited equipment. It has been growing ever since and <br>
        evolved into the very respectable laboratory that you find today. Below are some photos to show off some of its features.</p>
